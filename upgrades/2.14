# == SUMMARY ==
# - Replace list of variable names in a polynomial Ring with the number of variables (for data files escaped between releases)
# - Rename GROEBNER.ORDER into GROEBNER.ORDER_NAME
# - Delete N_INEQUALITIES, N_EQUATIONS and SUPPORT_SIZE
# - In Matroids, rename POINTS, BINARY_POINTS and TERNARY_POINTS into VECTORS, BINARY_VECTORS and TERNARY_VECTORS resp.
