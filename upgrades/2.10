# == SUMMARY ==
# - In Polytope:
#   * replace AMBIENT_DIM by CONE_AMBIENT_DIM
#   * replace DIM by CONE_DIM or COMBINATORIAL_DIM, depending on presence of geometric information
# - In PointConfiguration:
#   * rename POLYTOPE_AMBIENT_DIM and POLYTOPE_DIM to AMBIENT_DIM and DIM resp.
# - In PolyhedralFan:
#   * adjust values of COMBINATORIAL_DIM and MAXIMAL_CONES_DIMS, rename the latter to MAXIMAL_CONES_COMBINATORIAL_DIMS
#   * rename AMBIENT_DIM and DIM to FAN_AMBIENT_DIM and FAN_DIM resp.
# - Move FACET_TRIANGULATIONS to BOUNDARY.FACET_TRIANGULATIONS in TRIANGULATION
# - In Polytope and PointConfiguration with WEIGHTS, either create a POLYTOPAL_SUBDIVISION or move weights into TRIANGULATION
