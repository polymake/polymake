   @brief Takes a Pruefer sequence encoding a combinatorial type of n-marked rational curve and
   decodes it into the edge partitions of the corresponding graph
   @param Vector<Int> seq The Pruefer sequence. Should be of length
   n + (no of bounded edges -1) and should contain only entries in (n,..) and each entry
   should occur at least twice.
   @param Int  The number of leafs. If not given (or set to something negative), the function assumes
   that the Pruefer sequence is ordered and that the first entry is hence equal to the number of leaves.
   @return Vector<Set<Int>> A list of the partitions each edge induces.
   The leaves are given with indices (0,..,n-1) and each set is given such that it doesn't contain (n-1).
