/**
   @brief This computes the set of all Pruefer sequences of order n fulfilling one of a list of certain valency condition. These conditions are given as a matrix of integers, seen as a list of row vectors. Each row has length k+1, where k is the number of bounded edges. Column c_i, i= 0,..,k stands for the interior vertex labelled n+i and indicates what valence it should have. That means that in a sequence corresponding to row r the vertex n+i occurs valences(r,i)-1 times.
   @param Int n The number of leaves of rational curves for which we compute Pruefer sequences.
   @param Matrix<Int> valences. Each row prescribes a valence for each interior vertex
   @return Matrix<Int> A list of all Pruefer sequences fulfilling one of the valency conditions (as row vectors).
