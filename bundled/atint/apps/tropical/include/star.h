   @brief Computes the Star around a point in a given set of cones
   @param point The point around which the star is to be computed, given in non-trop.-homog. coordinates
   @param rays The rays of the surrounding cones (needn't contain point) in non-trop.-homog. coordinates
   @param cones The surrounding cones (i.e. should all contain point). Should form a complex.
   @param result_rays Will contain the rays of the result (without leading zeros). Might not be irredundant
   @param result_cones Will contain the cones of the result. A cone might be given by a redundant list of rays. The cones will be in the exact same order as in "cones", i.e. the i-th fan cone is the star of the i-th cone at point. Note that the rays are not in any way irredundant (but we don't care for this computation)
