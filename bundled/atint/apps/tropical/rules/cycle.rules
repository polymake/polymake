	## PROPERTIES ###########################################

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# For each lattice normal vector, this gives a vector of length (number of rays) + (lineality dim.), such that
	# if a rational function is given by values on the rays and lin space generators,
	# the value of the corresponding normal [[LATTICE_NORMALS]]->{i}->{j} can be computed by
	# multiplying the function value vector with the vector [[LATTICE_NORMAL_FCT_VECTOR]]->{i}->{j}.
	# This is done in the following way:
	# We use the generating system (and indices refer to SEPARATED_VERTICES) <(r_i-r_0)_i>0, s_j, l_k>,
	# where r_0 is the ray of the maximal cone with the lowest index in [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]],
	# such that it fulfills x0 = 1, r_i are the remaining rays with x0 = 1, ordered according to their index
	# in [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]], s_j are the rays of the cone with x0 = 0 and l_k are the lineality space
	# generators. We will then store the coefficients a_i of (r_i - r_0) at the index of r_i, then - sum(a_i) at
	# the index of r_0 and the remaining coefficients at the appropriate places.
	# In particular, the value of a lattice normal under a rational function can be computed
	# simply by taking the scalar product of RAY_VALUES | LIN_VALUES with this FCT_VECTOR
	property LATTICE_NORMAL_FCT_VECTOR : Map<Pair<Int,Int>,Vector<Rational>>;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# Rows of this matrix correspond to [[CODIMENSION_ONE_POLYTOPES]], and each row contains the weighted sum:
	# sum_{cone > codim-1-face}( weight(cone) * [[LATTICE_NORMALS]]->{codim-1-face}->{cone})
	property LATTICE_NORMAL_SUM : Matrix<Rational>;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# Rows of this matrix correspond to [[SEPARATED_CODIMENSION_ONE_POLYTOPES]] and each row contains a function vector
	# for the corresponding row of [[LATTICE_NORMAL_SUM]]. This function vector is computed
	# in the same way as described under [[LATTICE_NORMAL_FCT_VECTOR]].
	# Note that for any codim-1-faces at which the complex is not balanced, the corresponding row is a zero row.
	# If a face is balanced can be checked under [[UNBALANCED_FACES]].
	property LATTICE_NORMAL_SUM_FCT_VECTOR : Matrix<Rational>;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# Indexes of faces in [[CODIMENSION_ONE_POLYTOPES]] the complex is not balanced at.
	property UNBALANCED_FACES : Set<Int>;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# Whether the cycle is balanced. As many functions in a-tint can
	# deal with non-balanced complexes, we include this as a property.
	property IS_BALANCED : Bool;

	# @category Defining morphisms and functions
	# This is a matrix of vertices of the complex. More precisely, each ray r from [[VERTICES]] occurs
	# as a row in this matrix...
	# - once, if r_0 = 1
	# - k times, if r_0 = 0 and k is the number of equivalence classes of maximal cones
	# containing r with respect to the following relation:
	# Two maximal cones m, m' containing r are equivalent, if they are equal or there exists a sequence
	# of maximal cones m = m_1,...m_r = m', such that r is contained in each m_i and each intersection
	# m_i cap m_i+1 contains at least one ray s with s_0 = 1.
	# The reason for this is that, when for example specifying a piecewise affine linear function on a
	# polyhedral complex, the same far ray with x0 = 0 might be assigned two different values, if it is
	# contained in two "non-connected" maximal cones (where connectedness is to be understood as described above).
	# If there is a [[LOCAL_RESTRICTION]] the above equivalence relation is changed in such a
	# way that the affine ray s with s_0 = 1 that must be contained in the intersection of
	# two subsequent cones must be a compatible ray
	property SEPARATED_VERTICES : Matrix<Rational>;

	# @category Defining morphisms and functions
	# An incidence matrix describing which maximal polytope in the complex us generated by which rays.
	# Each row corresponds to a maximal polytope (More precisely, the i-th element represents the
	# same maximal polytope as the i-th element of [[MAXIMAL_POLYTOPES]]). The indices in a row refer to rows
	# of [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]], i.e. the maximal polytope described by the i-th element is generated by
	# the vertices corresponding to these row indices.
	property SEPARATED_MAXIMAL_POLYTOPES : IncidenceMatrix;

	# @category Defining morphisms and functions
	# An incidence matrix describing which codimension one polytope in the complex is generated by which vertices.
	# Each row corresponds to a codimension one polytope (More precisely, the i-th element represents the
	# same codim 1 polytope as the i-th element of [[CODIMENSION_ONE_POLYTOPES]]). The indices in a row refer
	# to rows of [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]].
	property SEPARATED_CODIMENSION_ONE_POLYTOPES : IncidenceMatrix;

	# @category Defining morphisms and functions
	# A vector with an entry for each row in [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]].
	# More precisely, the i-th entry gives the row index of the ray in [[VERTICES]]
	# that is equal to the i-th row of [[SEPARATED_VERTICES]].
	property SEPARATED_CONVERSION_VECTOR : Vector<Int>;

	# @category Local computations
	# This contains a list of sets of ray indices (referring to [[VERTICES]]). All of these sets should
	# describe polyhedra of the polyhedral complex (though not necessarily maximal ones).
	# A polyhedron is now called compatible with this property, if it contains one of these polyhedra
	# If this list is not empty, all computations will be done only on (or around) compatible cones.
	# The documentation of each property will explain in what way this restriction is enforced.
	# If this list is empty or not defined, there is no restriction.
	# Careful: The implementation assumes that ALL maximal cones are compatible. If in doubt,
	# you can create a complex with a local restriction from a given complex by using one of
	# the "local_..." creation methods
	# This list is assumed to be irredundant, i.e. there are no doubles (though this should not
	# break anything, it is simply less efficient). It is, however, possible that one element
	# is a subset of another.
	property LOCAL_RESTRICTION : IncidenceMatrix;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# This is an irredundant list of all lattice generators of all maximal polyhedra.
	# If this property exists, lattice normals might be computed faster
	property LATTICE_GENERATORS : Matrix<Integer>;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# This incidence matrix gives a lattice basis for each maximal polytope. More precisely it
	# gives a lattice basis whose span contains the lattice of the maximal polytope. Row i
	# corresponds to cone i and gives lattice generator indices referring to [[LATTICE_GENERATORS]].
	# If this property is computed via rules, it does indeed give a lattice basis for the
	# cone lattice, but when it is computed during an operation like refinement or divisor
	# it will in general be larger.
	# If this property exists, lattice normals might be computed faster.
	property LATTICE_BASES : IncidenceMatrix;

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# A Z-basis (as rows) for the space of weight distributions on this

	# @category Weights and lattices
	# The dual of [[WEIGHT_SPACE]].
