# @topic category any/Intersection theory
# These are general +++ related to intersection theory.

# @topic category any/Defining morphisms and functions
# These +++ are used to define morphisms or rational functions on a Cycle.

# @topic category any/Local computations
# These +++ are used for doing computations locally around a specified part of a Cycle,
# given via a nontrivial [[LOCAL_RESTRICTION]].

# @topic category any/Creation functions for specific cycles
# These +++ are special +++ for creating special tropical cycles.

# @topic category any/Creation function for specific morphisms and functions
# These +++ create specific morphisms and functions.

# @topic category any/Basic polyhedral operations
# These +++ provide basic functionality related to polyhedral geometry, but not
# necessarily to tropical geometry

# @topic category any/Divisor computation
# These +++ deal with the computation of divisors

# @topic category any/Degeneracy tests
# These +++ test cycles for degeneracy, i.e. whether a cycle is the empty cycle

# @topic category any/Abstract rational curves
# These +++ deal with abstract rational n-marked curves.

# @topic category any/Moduli of rational curves
# These +++ deal with moduli spaces of abstract or parametrized rational curves.

# @topic category any/Matroids
# These +++ deal with matroids and matroidal fans.

# @topic category any/Lattices
# These +++ deal with lattices (meaning free abelian, finitely generated groups).

# @topic category any/Morphisms
# These are general +++ that deal with morphisms and their arithmetic.

# @topic category any/Weight space
# These +++ deal with the weight space of a cycle, i.e. the space of weights
# that make it balanced and related properties.

# @topic category any/Hurwitz cycles
# These +++ deal with the creation and study of tropical Hurwitz cycles.

# @topic category any/Lines in surfaces 
# These +++ deal with the computation and representation of (families of) lines
# in surfaces.

# @topic category any/Matroid data
# These +++ are concerned with the underlying matroid combinatorics of a 
# [[MatroidRingCycle]].

# @topic category any/Matroid ring cycle arithmetics
# These +++ deal with the arithmetics of [[MatroidRingCycle]] objects.

# @topic category any/Inverse problems
# These +++ deal with finding rational functions to given divisors.
