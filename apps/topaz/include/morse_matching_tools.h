 *
 * We use a depth-first-search (DFS) to detect (directed) cycles in the Hasse diagram
 * where arcs whose value is @c true are reversed. Such cycles cannot span several
 * levels. We therefore search each level individually. The parameter @c lower stores
 * whether the current node @a v is on the lower or the upper part of the level.
 *
 * To avoid reinitialization of @c marked we use the following convention for the markers:
 * - if the marker is less than @c base, the node has not been visited
 * - if the marker is equal to @c base, the node is in the current active subtree
 * - if the marker is equal to @c base + 1, the node and all its children have been processed.
 *
 * If we find an arc from @a v to some node marked with @c base we found a cycle.
 * If its mark is less than @c base we recurse on this node. If the mark is @c base + 1
 * we found a node in a different part of the tree, which does not yield a cycle.
 *
 * This function is called, e.g. from @p checkAcyclic.

/**@brief Improve a Morse matching by canceling critical faces along alternating paths.
 * @param M            Morse matching in Hasse diagram
 * @param size         size of the computed solution
 * @param bottomLevel  lowest level to consider
 * @param topLevel     highest level to consider
 *
 * An alternating path w.r.t. a given Morse matching @a M is a path in the modified
 * Hasse diagram @a H(M) starting at a critical face and ending at a critical face;
 * it is called alternating because normal arcs and flipped arcs alternate on this
 * path. Forman observed that if there exists a @a unique alternating path then
 * one can flip the direction of every arc in the path to again obtain a Morse
 * matching. The two critical faces at the end of the path are not critical w.r.t.
 * the new Morse matching.
 *
 * Alternating paths can be found by a modified DFS as follows. We work on the
 * acyclic graph @a H(M) and start at a critical face @a u and then recurse. Initially
 * all faces have been marked 0. Let @a v be the current face and @a a = (@a v,@a w)
 * be an out-arc of @a v. If @a w has not been visited (its mark is 0), then we mark
 * @a w with 1 and set the DFS tree arc to be @a a. If @a w has been visited (marked
 * with a positive number) then we increase its mark by one.
 *
 * After running this algorithm we can check each critical face @a v (not equal
 * to @a u). If its mark is 1, we check whether each face on the path from @a v to
 * @a u is marked with 1. If this is the case, then we found a unique path from @a u
 * to @a v. This can be seen as follows:
 *
 * If there exists a unique path, then every face @a w on the path to @a v is visited
 * exactly once (so it is marked with 1).
 *
 * Conversely, assume that the path is not unique, i.e. there exist at least two
 * distinct paths from @a u to @a v (if there exists no path, then @a v is not marked).
 * DFS follows each path until it reaches an already visited face @a w; then the mark
 * of @a w is increased by one. Hence, at least one face on every path from @a u to
 * @a v has mark at least 2 (twice visisted).
 *
 * The algorithm is then simple to describe. We first compute all critical faces
 * w.r.t. the current solution. We loop over all critical faces @a u and run the
 * modified DFS. If there exists a critical face such that each face on the path to
 * @a u is marked with 1, we flip all arcs and set the two endpoints as non-critical.
 *
 * Note that the result may depend on the order of the paths flipped.
