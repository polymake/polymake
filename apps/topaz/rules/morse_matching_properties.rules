# A Morse matching is a reorientation of the arcs in the Hasse diagram of a simplicial complex
# such that at most one arc incident to each face is reoriented (matching condition) and the
# resulting orientation is acyclic (acyclicity condition). Morse matchings capture the main
# structure of discrete Morse functions, see
#
#	Robin Forman: Morse Theory for Cell-Complexes,
#	Advances in Math., 134 (1998), pp. 90-145.
#
# This property is computed by one of two heuristics. The default heuristic is
# a simple greedy algorithm ([[topaz::SimplicialComplex|greedy]]). The alternative is to use a canceling algorithm
# due to Forman ([[topaz::SimplicialComplex|cancel]]) or both ([[topaz::SimplicialComplex|both]]) together. Note that the computation of a Morse matching of largest
# size is NP-hard. See
