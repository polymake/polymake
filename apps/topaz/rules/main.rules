# @topic application
# The __TOP__ology __A__pplication __Z__oo deals with abstract simplicial complexes.
# A complex is given as a list of facets.  You can ask for its global properties ([[SimplicialComplex::MANIFOLD|manifold recognition]],
# [[SimplicialComplex::HOMOLOGY|homology groups]], etc.),  explore the local vertex environment ([[star|stars]], [[link_complex|links]], etc.),  and make a lot
# of constructions.
#
# The visualization means are constrained, as they are mostly based on the [[GRAPH]] (1-skeleton) of a complex.
