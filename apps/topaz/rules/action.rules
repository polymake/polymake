# @category Symmetry
# Compute the combinatorial symmetries (i.e., automorphisms of the face lattice) of
# a given simplicial complex. They are stored in terms of a GROUP.RAYS_ACTION and a GROUP.FACETS_ACTION
# property, and the GROUP.RAYS_ACTION is also returned.
# @param SimplicialComplex sigma
# @return group::PermutationAction the action of the combinatorial symmetry group on the vertices
# @example To get the vertex symmetry group of the square and print its generators, type the following:
# > $sigma = new SimplicialComplex(FACETS=>[[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,3]]);
# > print combinatorial_symmetries($sigma)->GENERATORS;
# | 3 2 1 0
# | 0 3 2 1
# > print $sigma->GROUP->RAYS_ACTION->GENERATORS;
# | 0 3 2 1
# | 1 0 3 2
# > print $sigma->GROUP->FACETS_ACTION->GENERATORS;
# | 3 2 1 0
# | 0 3 2 1
