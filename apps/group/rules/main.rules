# @topic application
# The application group provides basic functionality for working with permutation groups. 
#
# An object of type [[Group]] records the abstract properties of the groups 
# that do not depend on any particular representation, such as [[Group::ORDER|ORDER]],
# [[Group::CHARACTER_TABLE|CHARACTER_TABLE]] and [[Group::CONJUGACY_CLASS_SIZES|CONJUGACY_CLASS_SIZES]].
#
# Moreover, it can contain several subobjects of type [[PermutationAction]], [[PermutationActionOnSets]] 
# or [[ImplicitActionOnSets]] that encode representations of the group. (We use the terms //action//
# and //representation// interchangeably). 
#
# If the group object is not contained inside a [[polytope::Cone]] or [[polytope::Polytope]],
# the representation in question is encoded as a [[Group::PERMUTATION_ACTION]], [[Group::SET_ACTION]] or 
# [[Group::IMPLICIT_SET_ACTION]], otherwise it may be encoded more specifically as a RAY_ACTION, FACET_ACTION,
# COORDINATE_ACTION, etc. 
#
# Different representations of the same group are convertible among each other either via specific rules, 
# or by using the function [[induced_action]], for example.
