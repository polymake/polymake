   # A switch table is a tool for finding lex-maximal or -minimal in orbits
   # under the action of a permutation group. Its main ingredient is an
   # upper-left triangular matrix with group elements as entries.
   # See https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04746
   #
   # The output contains the support at every level, i.e. a number and a
   # Set<Int>, the number is the size of the support and and the Set<Int> are
   # the indices of those entries that can be permuted to the index of the
   # current level while keeping previous level indices fixed. I.e. entry [i,j]
   # will keep the first i entries of a vector fixed, while moving the j-th
   # entry to position i. Note that we start counting at 0!
   #
   # @example
   # > $P = new PermutationAction(GENERATORS=>[[1,2,0,4,5,3],[2,1,0,5,4,3]]);
   # > print $P->SWITCH_TABLE;
   # |   Supports: (size, content)
   # | Level 0: 3 {0 1 2}
   # | Level 1: 2 {1 2}
   # |   Entries:
   # | [0,0]: 0 1 2 3 4 5
   # | [0,1]: 1 0 2 4 3 5
   # | [0,2]: 1 2 0 4 5 3
   # | [1,1]: 0 1 2 3 4 5
   # | [1,2]: 0 2 1 3 5 4
