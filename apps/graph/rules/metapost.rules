# Produce a MetaPost input file with given visual objects.

# @option [complete file] String File "filename" or "AUTO"
#  The MetaPost description always has to be stored in a file, there is no interactive viewer for this
#  kind of visualization.
#
#  For the file name you can use any expression allowed for the ''open'' function,
#  including "-" for terminal output, "&HANDLE" for an already opened file handle,
#  or "| program" for a pipe.  Real file names are automatically completed with the ''.mp'' suffix if needed.
#
#  The default setting "AUTO" lets the file name be derived from the drawing title.
#  The automatically generated file name is displayed in the verbose mode.
# @example [nocompare] The following prints a metapost description of the complete graph with 3 nodes in the console:
# > metapost(complete(3)->VISUAL,File=>"-");

user_function metapost(Visual::Object+, { File => "AUTO" }) {
