# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from matroids
# These functions construct a new [[Matroid]] from other objects of the same type.

# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from scratch
# With these clients you can create special examples of matroids belonging to parameterized families.

# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from other objects
# These functions construct a new [[Matroid]] from other objects.

# @topic category any/Realizability
# Functions related to the realizability over certain fields.

# @topic category any/Advanced properties
# More complex properties of the matroid.

object Matroid {

# @topic category any/Axiom systems
# These are +++ that form (part of) an axiom system defining a matroid.
# Most of these can be used to create a matroid.

# @topic category any/Enumerative properties
# These are +++ of a matroid that count something.

# @topic category properties/Input properties
# These are properties that can be used to define a matroid, but do not actually constitute an axiom system.

# @topic category any/Valuation
# +++ related to the valuation of the matroid.

# @topic category any/Duality
# +++ related to duality and dual properties.
