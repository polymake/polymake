# The class group Cl(X) of Weil divisors on the toric variety
# defined by the fan is a finitely generated abelian group of rank [[PolyhedralFan::N_RAYS|N_RAYS]]-[[PolyhedralFan::DIM|DIM]].
# It usually contains torsion.
# The rational divisor class group is the tensor product of Cl(X) with Q over Z.
# This group is torsion free and corresponds to the Picard group if the variety is non-singular.
