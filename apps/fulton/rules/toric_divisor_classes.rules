# FIXME 
#   here we need a configure block that checks 
#     - whether the ntl extension is installed
#     - can read the ntl path and appropriate includes from it
#   (see ticket #504)
# 
#     - the current version uses CallPolymakeFunction to access integer_kernel
#        and fails with an error if this is not found
