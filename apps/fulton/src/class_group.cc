// rational_divisor_class_group provides a pair of matrices: 
// a projection map to the class group, and a lifting map to a deivisor on the fan
// 
// let A be the matrix with rows the primitive generators of the fan
// the projection equals Gale transform of A, 
// i.e. a matrix G such that the cols g of G span the kernel of A in the form g^tA=0
// this implies that if divisors x,y 
// (i.e. right hand sides for the polytope defined by the normal fan spanned by A)
// are mapped to the same element:
// if x^tG=y^tG, then there is p such that x-y=Ap, i.e. x and y differ by a linear map
// (or, seen as right hand side of a polytope, they differ by a translation)
// 
// for the converse direction we write G as D=LGR for unimodular matrices L,R (Smith normal form)
// by construction, D is diagonal (as far as possible), and there are only ones on the diagonal
// we can then lift with R*L.minor(range(0,rk(D)-1),All)
