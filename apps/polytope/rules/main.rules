# @topic application
# This is the historically first application, and the largest one.
#
# It deals with convex pointed polyhedra.  It allows to define a polyhedron either as a convex hull of a point set, an intersection of
# halfspaces, or as an incidence matrix without any embedding.  Then you can ask for a plenty of its (especially combinatorial)
# properties,  construct new polyhedra by modifying it,  or study the behavior of the objective functions.
#
# There is a wide range of visualization methods for polyhedra, even for dimensions > 4 and purely combinatorial descriptions,
# including interfaces to interactive geometry viewers (such as [[wiki:external_software#JavaView|JavaView]] or [[wiki:external_software#geomview|geomview]]), generating
# PostScript drawings and povray scene files.

# A polyhedral cone, not necessarily pointed.
# Note that in contrast to the vertices of a polytope, the [[RAYS]] are given in affine coordinates.
# @tparam Scalar numeric data type used for the coordinates, must be an ordered field
declare object Cone<Scalar=Rational> [ is_ordered_field(Scalar) ];

# Not necessarily bounded convex polyhedron, i.e., the feasible region of a linear program.
# Nonetheless, the name "Polytope" is used for two reasons: Firstly, as far as the combinatorics
# is concerned we always deal with polytopes; see the description of [[VERTICES_IN_FACETS]] for details.
# Note that a pointed polyhedron is projectively equivalent to a polytope.
# The second reason is historical.
# We use homogeneous coordinates, which is why Polytope is derived from [[Cone]].
# @example To construct a polytope as the convex hull of three points in the plane use
# > $p=new Polytope(POINTS=>[[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]);
# > print $p->N_FACETS
# | 3
# Note that homogeneous coordinates are used throughout.
#
# @example Many standard constructions are available directly.  For instance, to get a regular 120-cell (which is 4-dimensional) use:
# > $c=regular_120_cell();
# > print $c->VOLUME;
# | 1575+705r5
# This is the exact volume 1575+705*\sqrt{5}.
# polymake has limited support for polytopes with non-rational coordinates.
declare object Polytope<Scalar=Rational> [ is_ordered_field(Scalar) ] : Cone<Scalar>;
