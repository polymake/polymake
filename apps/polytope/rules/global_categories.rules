# @topic category any/Lattice points in polytopes
# These +++ capture information that depends on the lattice structure of the polytope.
# polymake always works with the integer lattice.

# @topic category any/Lattice points in cones
# These +++ capture information that depends on the lattice structure of the cone.
# polymake always works with the integer lattice. 

# @topic category any/Unbounded polyhedra
# These +++ collect geometric information of a polytope only relevant if it is unbounded, e. g. the far face or the complex of bounded faces.

# @topic category any/Optimization
# These +++ provide tools from linear, integer and dicrete optimization. In particular, linear programs are defined here.

# @topic category any/Triangulation and volume
# These +++ collect information about triangulations of the object and properties usually computed from such, as the volume.

# @topic category any/Triangulations, subdivisions and volume
# These +++ collect information about triangulations and other subdivisions of the object and properties usually computed from such, as the volume.

# @topic category any/Consistency check
# These +++ are for checking the consistency of some properties.
