# Linear objective function. In d-space a linear objective function is given by a (d+1)-vector. 
# The first coordinate specifies a constant that is added to the resulting value.
# @example The following creates a new LinearProgram object and assigns a linear objective to it:
# > $l = cube(2)->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>[0,1,1]);
# > print $l->LINEAR_OBJECTIVE;
# | 0 1 1
property LINEAR_OBJECTIVE : Vector<Scalar>;


# Abstract objective function.  Defines a direction for each edge such that each non-empty
# face has a unique source and a unique sink. 
# The i-th element is the value of the objective function at vertex number i.
# Only defined for bounded polytopes.
# @example The following creates a new LinearProgram object and assigns an abstract objective to it:
# > $l = cube(2)->LP(ABSTRACT_OBJECTIVE=>[1,2,3,4]);
# > print $l->ABSTRACT_OBJECTIVE;
# | 1 2 3 4
property ABSTRACT_OBJECTIVE : Vector<Scalar>;


# Indices of vertices at which the maximum of the objective function is attained.
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with side length 2 and asks
# for the maximal face:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 0]);
# > $p = cube(2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MAXIMAL_FACE;
# | {1 3}
property MAXIMAL_FACE : Set;

# Similar to [[MAXIMAL_FACE]].
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with side length 2 and asks
# for the minimal face:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 0]);
# > $p = cube(2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MINIMAL_FACE;
# | {0 2}
property MINIMAL_FACE : Set;


# Coordinates of a (possibly not unique) affine vertex at which the maximum of the objective function is attained.
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with
# side length 2 and asks for a maximal vertex:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, -1/2]);
# > $p = cube(2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MAXIMAL_VERTEX;
# | 1 1 -1
property MAXIMAL_VERTEX : Vector<Scalar>;

# Similar to [[MAXIMAL_VERTEX]].
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with side length 2 and asks
# for a minimal vertex:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 0]);
# > $p = cube(2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MINIMAL_VERTEX;
# | 1 -1 -1
property MINIMAL_VERTEX : Vector<Scalar>;

# Maximum value of the objective function. Negated if linear problem is unbounded.
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with side length 2 and asks
# for the maximal value:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 0]);
# > $p = cube(2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MAXIMAL_VALUE;
# | 1
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective with bias 3 for the centered square with side length 4 and asks
# for the maximal value:
# > $c = new Vector([3, 1, 0]);
# > $p = cube(2,2);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MAXIMAL_VALUE;
# | 5
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the positive quadrant (unbounded) and asks
# for the maximal value:
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 1]);
# > $p = facet_to_infinity(simplex(2),0);
# > $p->LP(LINEAR_OBJECTIVE=>$c);
# > print $p->LP->MAXIMAL_VALUE;

# Similar to [[MAXIMAL_VALUE]].

# Subgraph of [[Polytope::GRAPH]]. Consists only of directed arcs along which the value of the objective function increases.
# @example The following defines a LinearProgram together with a linear objective for the centered square with side length 2. The directed
# graph according to the linear objective is stored in a new variable and the corresponding edges are printend.
# > $c = new Vector([0, 1, 0]);
