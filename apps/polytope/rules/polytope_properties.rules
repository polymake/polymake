# A rational polyhedron realized in Q^d

# @topic objects/Polytope/specializations/Polytope<Float>
# A pointed polyhedron with float coordinates realized in R<sup>d</sup>.
#
# It mainly exists for visualization.
#
# Convex hull and related algorithms use floating-point arithmetics.
# Due to numerical errors inherent to this kind of computations, the resulting
# combinatorial description can be arbitrarily far away from the truth, or even
# not correspond to any valid polytope.  You have been warned.
#
# None of the standard construction clients produces objects of this type.

# @category Input property
# Points such that the polyhedron is their convex hull.
# Redundancies are allowed.
# The vector (x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, ... x<sub>d</sub>) represents a point in d-space given in homogeneous coordinates.
# Affine points are identified by x<sub>0</sub> > 0.
# Points with x<sub>0</sub> = 0 can be interpreted as rays.
#
# polymake automatically normalizes each coordinate vector, dividing them by the first non-zero element.
# The clients and rule subroutines can always assume that x<sub>0</sub> is either 0 or 1.
# All vectors in this section must be non-zero.
# Dual to [[INEQUALITIES]].
#
# Input section only.  Ask for [[VERTICES]] if you want to compute a V-representation from an H-representation.
# @example Given some (homogeneous) points in 3-space we first construct a matrix containing them. Assume we don't know wether these are all
# vertices of their convex hull or not. To safely produce a polytope from these points, we set the input to the matrix representing them.
# In the following the points under consideration are the vertices of the 3-simplex together with their barycenter, which will be no vertex:
# > $M = new Matrix([[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,1/4,1/4,1/4]]);
# > $p = new Polytope(POINTS=>$M);

# @category Geometry
# Vertices of the polyhedron. No redundancies are allowed.
# All vectors in this section must be non-zero.
# The coordinates are normalized the same way as [[POINTS]]. Dual to [[FACETS]].
# This section is empty if and only if the polytope is empty.
# The property [[VERTICES]] appears only in conjunction with the property [[LINEALITY_SPACE]].
# The specification of the property [[VERTICES]] requires the specification of [[LINEALITY_SPACE]], and vice versa.
# @example To print the vertices (in homogeneous coordinates) of the standard 2-simplex, i.e. a right-angled isoceles triangle, type this:
# > print simplex(2)->VERTICES;
# | (3) (0 1)
# | 1 1 0
# | 1 0 1
# @example If we know some points to be vertices of their convex hull, we can store them as rows in a Matrix and construct a new polytope with it.
# The following produces a 3-dimensioanl pyramid over the standard 2-simplex with the specified vertices:
# > $M = new Matrix([[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,3]]);
# > $p = new Polytope(VERTICES=>$M);
# @example The following adds a (square) pyramid to one facet of a 3-cube. We do this by extracting the vertices of the cube via the built-in
# method and then attach the apex of the pyramid to the matrix.
# > $v = new Vector([1,0,0,3/2]);
# > $M = cube(3)->VERTICES / $v;
