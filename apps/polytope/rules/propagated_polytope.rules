# Polytope propagation means to define a polytope inductively by assigning vectors to arcs
# of a directed graph.  At each node of such a graph a polytope arises as the joint convex hull
# of the polytopes at the translated sources of the inward pointing arcs.
#
# For details see 
#	Joswig: Polytope Propagation on Graphs.
