# @file integer_hull
#
# Script to generate the integer hull arising from a given LP file,
# i.e., the convex hull of all lattice points in the polytope given by
# the file is computed.
#
# More precisely, the following is done:
# - a linear system is read from an LP file
# - the integer points (lattice points) in the LP-relaxation are generated
# - the facets of the convex hull of these integer points are computed
# - the corresponding polytope is returned
#
# The script is intended for people that want to see the facets for
# problems for which they know an LP-relaxation. Usually, the
# LP-relaxation can be generated by hand or a modelling language like
# ZIMPL. This script (and polymake) does the rest.
#
# Note that the script assumes that all variables are integer. To
# handle mixed-integer problems one needs to do a projection step
# first. This would be interesting to implement. Furthermore, the
# input needs to be bounded.
