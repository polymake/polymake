# @topic category functions/Producing a tropical hypersurface
# These functions produce a [[Hypersurface|tropical hypersurface]] from other objects.

# @topic category functions/Producing a tropical polytope
# These functions produce an object of type [[Polytope]] from other objects.

# @topic category any/Weights and lattices
# These +++ relate to the weights of a tropical cycle.

# @topic category any/Affine and projective coordinates
# These +++ deal with affine and projective coordinates, conversion between those 
# and properties like dimension that change in projective space.

# @topic category any/Conversion of tropical addition
# These +++ deal with the conversion of tropical objects between Min and Max.

# @topic category any/Tropical operations
# These +++ deal with general tropical arithmetic.

# @topic category any/Tropical covector decomposition
# These +++ deal with covectors of subdivision of tropical point configurations.

# @topic category any/Tropical linear spaces
# These +++ deal with tropical linear spaces associated to valuated matroids.

# @topic category any/gfan
# These +++ are wrappers for gfan functions.
