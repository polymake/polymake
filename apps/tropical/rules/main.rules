# A tropical polytope is the tropical convex hull of finitely many points in tropical projective space.
# It should always be defined via [[POINTS]] instead of [[VERTICES]], as those define the combinatorics
# of the induced subdivision.
# @tparam Addition Either [[Min]] or [[Max]]. There is NO default for this, you have to choose!
# @tparam Scalar Rational by default. The underlying type of ordered group.
declare object Polytope<Addition, Scalar=Rational> [ is_ordered_field_with_unlimited_precision(Scalar) ];

# A tropical cycle is a weighted, balanced, pure polyhedral complex.
# It is given as a polyhedral complex in tropical projective coordinates.
# To be precise: Each row of [[VERTICES]] and [[LINEALITY_SPACE]]
# has a leading 1 or 0, depending on whether it is a vertex or a ray.
# The remaining n coordinates are interpreted as an element of
# R<sup>n</sup> modulo (1,..,1).
# IMPORTANT NOTE: VERTICES are assumed to be normalized such that the first coordinate (i.e.
# column index 1) is 0. If your input is not of that form, use [[PROJECTIVE_VERTICES]].
# Note that there is a convenience method [[thomog]], which converts affine coordinates
# into projective coordinates.
# @tparam Addition The tropical addition. Warning: There is NO default for this, you have to choose either [[Max]] or [[Min]].
declare object Cycle<Addition> : fan::PolyhedralComplex<Rational>;

# This is a special instance of a Cycle: It is the tropical locus of a
# polynomial over the tropical numbers.
