# A binomial ideal represents an ideal which is generated by polynomials of
# the form p(X) - q(X), where p(X) and q(X) are both multivariate monomials.
# For example, x1*x2^2 - x1x3x4^10 would be a polynomial of this form, but
# x1^2 + x1 and  2x1 - x3 are not polynomials of this form.
#
# Toric ideals of lattice polytopes are one example of an ideal which may
# be represented by such a generating set. Since these generator sets have a
# special form, they may be represented compactly with a matrix.
