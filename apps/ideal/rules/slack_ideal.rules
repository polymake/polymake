# The type SlackIdeal is a thin wrapper around [[Ideal]] that allows avoiding
# saturation. The current algorithm for computing the [[polytope::Polytope::SLACK_IDEAL]] of a
# [[polytope::Polytope]] first computes an ideal whose saturation is the actual slack
# ideal. This last step is very expensive and probably necessary for many
# applications. Hence the SlackIdeal contains a second ideal [[NON_SATURATED]]
# as a property and the actual saturation step is only done once one asks for
# the [[Ideal::GENERATORS]] of the SlackIdeal.
declare object SlackIdeal : Ideal {

   # An ideal whose saturation is the [[polytope::Polytope::SLACK_IDEAL]] of a [[polytope::Polytope]].
   property NON_SATURATED : Ideal;

   rule N_VARIABLES = NON_SATURATED.N_VARIABLES;
