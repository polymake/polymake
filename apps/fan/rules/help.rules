# @topic category functions/Producing a fan
# These clients provide standard constructions for [[PolyhedralFan]] objects, e.g. from polytopes ([[face_fan]] or [[normal_fan]]) or from other fans (via projection, refinement or product).

# @topic category functions/Producing a polyhedral complex
# These clients provide constructions for [[PolyhedralComplex]] objects.

# @topic category functions/Consistency check
# These clients provide consistency checks, e.g. whether a given list of rays and cones defines a polyhedral fan.

# @topic category properties/any/Toric Varieties
# Properties coming from associated toric varieties

# @topic category functions/Finite metric spaces
# All around Tight spans of finite metric spaces and their conections to polyhedral geometry
