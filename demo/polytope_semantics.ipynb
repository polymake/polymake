    "## Semantics of Cones and Polytopes\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The general semantics of a [big object](https://polymake.org/doku.php/user_guide/tutorials/properties#objects) in polymake is as follows: a list of properties describes an equivalence class of mathematical objects.  Often this equivalence class consists of a single element, but this is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example an object of class [Polytope](https://polymake.org/doku.php/documentation/latest/polytope/polytope) defined by `VERTICES` gives such a single element equivalence class.  A typical example of a class with several elements is a polytope given combinatorially, in terms of `VERTICES_IN_FACETS`.  An extreme case would be a Polytope object defined by `VOLUME` only, defining the set of polytopes of all possible dimensions which happen to have that volume.  While this  is not very useful, a similar example would be a Polytope object defined by `F_VECTOR` only.  From this it makes sense to derive, e.g., `N_VERTICES` or `H_VECTOR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All big objects are immutable as mathematical objects.  This means it is possible to add more properties, but only consistent ones.  Ideally, these properties pre-exist (since they are logically derived from the input description of the object), and the rules only make them explicit. If a user asks for a property which cannot be derived, this property is set to `undef`.  This occurs, e.g., if one asks for the `VERTICES` of a combinatorially defined polytope.\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the list properties that currently constitute your object, you can use the `properties` method."

    "With the introduction of the `Cone` class and redefining `Polytope` as a derived class (in version 2.9.10) this raises the question of how to deal with empty polytopes.\n",
    "This is a bit subtle as the cone over an empty polytope does not have a canonical definition.  Most text books hence exclude this case.  For them a polytope is never empty.  There was a time when this was also polymake's point of view (until version 2.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this was changed for the reason that often people generate systems of inequalities and then look at the feasible region.  Most of the time they obtain a polytope and proceed, but sometimes it fails, and the region is empty.  It is therefore necessary to give a definition of the empty polytope (geometrically) which is consistent:\n",
