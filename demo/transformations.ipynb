Moreover, even if this is the case, multiple VERTICES may be mapped to the same (like two onto one as in the example above).  If a polytope already has a double description, that is, both VERTICES and FACETS are known, then the VERTICES and FACETS of the image under a transformation (that is, a bijective map) cane be read off right away.
