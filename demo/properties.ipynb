    "### Objects\n",
    "In polymake, there is two kinds of objects. A *Big Object* models a complex mathematical concept, like a Polytope or a SimplicialComplex, while a *small object* is an instance of one of the many data types commonly used in computer science, like Integers, Matrices, Sets or Maps. A big object consists of a collection of other objects (big or small) describing it, called *properties*, and functions to compute more properties from the ones already known, called *production rules*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a more detailed explanation of the `polymake` object model and properties, check out the [scripting guide](https://polymake.org/doku.php/user_guide/howto/scripting#most_important_interfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save polymake objects to disc, as explained [here](data.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Each (big) object has a list of properties of various types.  When an object is 'born' it comes with an initial list of properties, and all other properties will be derived from those.  Let's look at example from the `polytope` application.  The following creates a 3-dimensional cube:"
