    "# Groups in polymake\n",
    "\n",
    "`polymake` can deal with symmetry groups acting on polytopes, point/vector configurations and simplicial complexes. This can take the guise of permutation or matrix groups acting on the set of vertices (points), facets, or coordinates of realizations of polytopes or point/vector configurations, or abstract permutation groups acting on the set of vertices or facets of a simplicial complex.\n",
    " \n",
    "Some functionality builds on `PermLib`, a `C++`-library for permutation computations written by [Thomas Rehn](http://www.math.uni-rostock.de/~rehn/index.html), but much functionality is built in natively into `polymake`. For example, you can natively calculate conjugation classes of permutation or matrix groups, projectors to the isotypic components of representations, or the invariant polynomials of a matrix representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General properties of groups\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the description of permutation groups in `polymake`. An object of type [ Group](https://polymake.org/release_docs/latest/group.html#group__Group__5 ) records the abstract properties of the groups that do not depend on any particular representation, which essentially are just the `ORDER`, `CHARACTER_TABLE`, and `CONJUGACY_CLASS_SIZES`. Moreover, a `Group` object can contain several subobjects that encode actions (representations) of the group, most notably a `PERMUTATION_ACTION` that encodes permutations of indices. If the Group object is contained inside a `Cone`, `Polytope`, `PointConfiguration`, or `VectorConfiguration`, it may be encoded more specifically as a `RAY_ACTION`, `FACET_ACTION`, etc. See the [ documentation](https://polymake.org/release_docs/latest/group.html ) for more information on the action types.\n",

Other properties, such as representatives for the conjugacy classes themselves, depend on the action chosen, and are thus stored inside the corresponding `*_ACTION` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the symmetric groups, we currently include the `CHARACTER_TABLE` up to degree 7; for the `group::dihedral_group` we provide the conjugacy classes in full generality, and the `CHARACTER_TABLE` in an exact form for the dihedral groups of order 10, 16, 20, and 24 (where it can be expressed using a single quadratic extension of the rationals). For the other dihedral groups, we provide `AccurateFloat` representations of the entries of the character table, as `polymake` currently cannot work with arbitrary cyclotomic integers.\n",
